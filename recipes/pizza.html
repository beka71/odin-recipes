        <h3>Desciption</h3>
            <p1>Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples.
             When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust,
            crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, 
            a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.</p1>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 pacage active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
            <li>fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
            <li>sea salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside</li>
            <li>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. 
                Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. 
                When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and 
                knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. 
                Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (27 to 35 degrees C) until doubled in volume,
                 about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. 
                Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough.
                 Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. 
                 Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls.</li>
            <li>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
